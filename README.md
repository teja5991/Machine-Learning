This is about Analysis of the Models performing on a particular Data Set

In machine learning we have three different types of learning
1. supervised learning
2. unsupervised learning
3. reinforcement learning

so basically in machine learning we work mainly on supervised learning.
when we talk about supervised learning there are classified into two models:
1. regression models
2. classification models

regression models are further classified into:
1. simple linear regression
2. multi linear regression
3. polynomial regression
4. decision tree regression
5. random forest regression

classification models are classified into:
1. logistic regression
2. KNN
3. Support vector machine
4. Naive Bayes
5. decision tree classification
6. random forest classification
