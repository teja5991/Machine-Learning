AIM

To find the family status of a particular entity based on his lifestyle of living

CONCEPT

Basically this project does not have any prepared dataset so we generate a dataset of 50000 rows randomly using random function so 
once we generatea random dataset with all the required attributes we convert the obtained dataset to a csv file and then use that 
dataset for the prediction of the model which is nothing but predicting family status of the particular entity 

PREPARATION OF DATASET

Dataset has mainly 15 attributes the attributes are
entity_id
city
marital_status
education
gender
dependencies
entity_income
entity_family_income
average_expenditure_per_month
total_income_of_entity_family
savings
car_loan
house_loan
family status
family_status_label

for some of the attributes we generate the data randomly. for the following attributes we generate the data randomly and the data is 
generated with the help of applying a random technique to it.
To choose an option to enter data for a feature is  by tossing the coin. If the Coin turns out to be head, then roll a dice with 
number of faces equal to the number of options a feature can take in case of a tail enter a predefined option

the attributes for which we apply this technique are
city
marital_status
education
gender
dependencies
entity_income

WORKING OF ATTRIBUTES

for city attribute we had predefined few cities which are A,B,C,D and if the entites are living in those cities we had predifined the
expenditure of that city per month the values are
city A = 15000
city B = 10000
city C = 5000
city D = 2500
so it will randomly genearte the city to all the 50000 entities

for marital status attribute we had already predefined as either married or unmarried so it will only assign these two values to all
the 50000 entities randomly

for education attribute we had predefined into 4 types PG,UG,Phd,Not educated so in these 4 values only it will assign the values to
all the 50000 entities randomly

for gender we had predefined already as either male or female so it will only assign these two values to all the 50000 entities 
randomly

for dependents attributes we had prefined range of 5 so it will generate any value from 0 to 5 and it will assign any of these values
to the 50000 entites randomly

for entity_income attribute the value is generated in range of starting 10000 to 2000000 it can assign any value to all the 50000 
entities

for entity_family_income attribute the value is generated in range of starting 10000 to 1000000 it can assign any value to all the 50000 
entities

for average_expenditure_per_month attribute is based on the values in which city they are living

for total_income_entity_family attribute is the combination of entity_income + entity_family_income

for savings attribute it is total_entity_family_income - average_expenditure_per_month

for car_loan attribute if the entity savings is more than 50000 then he can take car loan 

for house_loan attribute if the entity savings is more than 100000 then he can take home loan


OUTPUT

since feeding all the attributes as X and the family_status_label as Y we will be able to predict the family status of that particular
entity
